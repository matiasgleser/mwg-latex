# Microeconomic Theory (MWG, 1995): Definitions etc.

## Idea
This document compiles the definitions, propositions, corollaries, and lemmas from everyone's favourite Micro textbook:
Microeconomic Theory by Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green.

You cannot `Cmd+F` in the scanned PDF, but here you can.

## Structure
The content is copied verbatim (including italics).
All numberings and labels correspond to those in the book.

In some cases systems of equations given outside a proposition are referenced therein.
These references are resolved, i.e. the equations are copied into the propositions.

Some sections of the book contain no definitions etc.
These are not included.

## Typos
I am sure there are still typos in here.
