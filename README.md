# Microeconomic Theory (MWG, 1995): Definitions etc.

## Idea
This document compiles the definitions, propositions, and lemmas from everyone's favourite Micro textbook.

You cannot `Cmd+F` in the scanned PDF, but here you can.

## Structure
The content is copied verbatim (including italics).
In some cases systems of equations given outside a proposition are referenced therein.
These references are resolved, i.e. the equations are copied into the propositions.

## Status
The document is not finished.
*Part 2: Game Theory* will not be included (Rubinstein's notes are available as PDF).
*Part 5: Welfare Economics and Incentives* will be covered if I have spare time.

## If you are bored
Pull requests, or issues are appreciated, should you find any typos etc.
If you want to transcribe as well, fork the repo, and go ahead!
Pull requests will only be accepted if you maintain the coding style and organisation of the repo.
