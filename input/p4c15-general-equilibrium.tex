\section{Pure Exchange: The Edgeworth Box}

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{Walrasian} (or \emph{competitve}) \emph{equilibrium} for an Edgeworth box economy is a price vector $p^*$ and an allocation $x^* = (x^*_1, x^*_2)$ in the Edgeworth box such that for $i = 1, 2$,
    \begin{equation*}
        x^*_i \succsim_i x'_i \text{ for all } x'_i \in B_i(p^*).
    \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    An allocation $x$ in the Edgeworth box is \emph{Pareto optimal} (or \emph{Pareto efficient}) if there is no other allocation $x'$ in the Edgeworth box with $x'_i \succsim_i x_i$ for $i = 1, 2$ and $x'_i \succsim_i x_i$ for some $i$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    An allocation $x^*$ in the Edgeworth box is supportable as an \emph{equilibrium with transfers} if there is a price system $p^*$ and wealth transfers $T_1$ and $T_2$ satisfying $T_1 + T_2 = 0$, such that for each consumer $i$ we have
    \begin{equation*}
        x^*_i \succsim_i x'_i \text{ for all } x'_i \in \reals^2_+ \text{ such that } p^* \cdot x'_i \leq p^* \cdot \omega_i + T_i.
    \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\section{The 2 x 2 Production Model}

\begin{defn}
    The production of good $1$ is \emph{relatively more intensive in factor $1$} than is production of good $2$ if
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{a_{11}(w)}{a_{21}(w)} > \frac{a_{12}(w)}{a_{22}(w)}
    \end{equation*}
    at \emph{all} factor prices $w = (w_1, w_2)$.
\end{defn}
